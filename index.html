        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>People ask me how I afford all this camera stuff. Easy: I beg, borrow, and sometimes even buy it. I certainly don't still own everything I've reviewed here since 1999. I've also had real jobs for many years which pays for what I do buy, and I live like a hermit otherwise.</p>

        <p>That's the easy answer, but then I realized that I've always had a knack for buying expensive toys long before I'd ever had a job. Hopefully my cheapskate tricks can help you, too, which is why I share them here. </p>
    
        <p>Our ability to buy expensive toys has nothing to do with how much money we do or don't earn. Like everything in life, it has everything to do with how well you use what you have.</p>
     
        <p>I bought my first expensive single-lens reflex camera when I was an 11 year old kid. I saved my allowance, and still couldn't afford film. My dad was kind enough to buy me a roll every month or so if I was good.</p>
       
        <p>When we were little kids, my brother asked my dad "How come Kenny always can buy expensive things, but I can't, and we get the same allowance?" My dad responded that it was because my brother insisted on going out and buying everything as soon as he wanted it, but that I waited, saved, and did my homework to find the same things for less.</p>

        <p>Today that same brother, who has never had a real job as far as we know, has been traveling the world ever since he was in college. When asked how he does it with no particular source of income, he responds that "most people are too stupid to be poor." By that he means that most people waste what money they do have on stupid things, like new cars and eating in restaurants, and don't instead buy their food at the grocery store while traveling. He travels by carefully checking auctions for other peoples' unused weeks of time shares, so he will travel when he can bag a week in Paris or Tobago for just a couple of hundred dollars. He has to be ready to travel on a moment's notice when he wins these auctions, another advantage of having no real job. </p>

        <p>When I was in college I bought one of the world's first digital audio recorders to record my music gigs. I had never had a real job in my life. This was in 1981, two years before the CD came out and back when digital audio was beyond the means of most professional recording studios. Digital audio recorders cost the same as a house!</p>

        <p>I was 19. I bought the then-revolutionary new <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/audio/sony/pcm-f1.htm">Sony PCM-F1</a>, which sold for the amazingly low sum of $1,900 in 1981 ($4,400 in today's money). The next cheapest recorder had cost $50,000 the week before. I also had to buy a Betamax video recorder on which to save the data, an additional $1,100. Back in those days, VCRs were still as exotic as helicopters. This cost me a total of $3,000 in 1981 dollars, or $7,000 in today's money.</p>

        <p>How the heck could I do that? For comparison, my car had cost only $650!!!</p>

        <p>If a kid can afford toys more expensive than Nikon D3s, using their own very limited funds, anyone can.</p>

        <p>Sorry if this article starts to read like a self-help video, but honestly, if you can't afford these things today, you're going to have to make some changes in your life if you want to. It doesn't take money. It takes the guts to be a cheapskate. </p>

        <p>What I'll describe has always worked for me. I hope it helps you. Everyone's situations are different, but hopefully my skinflint lifestyle will give you the idea. This is all about prioritization and not wasting what you do have, so if you prioritize differently or enjoy spending money on something I consider wasteful, go right ahead. I certainly don't intend to offend anyone. </p>


        <h2>Cheap versus Frugal</h2>

        <p>I usually use the word "cheap" instead of frugal, but I mean frugal. I use "cheap" because it sounds funnier. </p>

        <p>Cheap means buying something obviously crappy, and only stupid people do that since they usually cost themselves more in the long run. For instance, a cheap person hires the wrong person to do a job, and winds up paying more to have a competent person have to fix the damage done by the first workman. Cheap means giving your girlfriend flowers picked out of a funeral home dumpster, and leaving the wrong sympathy card attached to them, That's going to cost you a lot more than you just saved! </p>

        <p>Frugality is entirely different. Being frugal means using your money well and not wasting. Being frugal often involves spending large sums on the right things, like hiring competent professionals to do a job, or buying a more durable, quality product that lasts far longer than a regular one.</p>

        <p>Everywhere I use the word "cheap" below, please realize I mean "frugal."</p>

        <p>Yes, as you may guess, I am part Scottish. </p>

        <h2>Prioritization</h2>

        <p>Half of being able to afford what you want is to spend your money on what you really want. </p>

        <p>This should be obvious, but most people are suckered out of their biggest chunks of money by blowing it on the wrong things. People spend money on the wrong things because the people who take that money make it so comfortable and easy. </p>

        <h3>Never Buy a New Car </h3>

        <p>I've only bought one new car in my life. That was over 20 years ago.</p>

        <p>Millions of Americans buy new cars every year. Every one of those people just pissed away much more than the price of an exotic new camera.</p>

        <p>Sure, I drive a Mercedes. Actually, I drive two Mercedes! I bought my first Mercedes from a friend in 1992. It looked and drove as if it was brand new. I sold it to my insurance company a year and 12,000 miles later after someone drove into it for $1,000 more than it cost me. I made money on this deal, far better than losing $15,000 on my new Ford that I sold when I got that Mercedes. </p>

        <p>I bought my <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/190d/index.htm">second used Mercedes</a> in 1993 for less than my sillier friends paid for a new Ford Taurus. All my pals thought I was loaded, since I was now driving what looked exactly like the new Mercedes you could buy at the dealer. Back then, Mercedes were still rare, expensive and exotic: my bottom-of-the line Mercedes sold new for the equivalent of $50,000 in today's dollars, and just like most Mercedes, looked exactly like the middle-of-the-line $80,000 (today's dollars) Mercedes of its day. I bought it after many months of searching for just the right one in perfect condition. I drove that Mercedes for 12 years and 80,000 miles, and sold it for only $6,000 less than it cost me! It still looked new, and the only reason I'm not still driving it today is because my vain wife wanted me to be in a newer looking car.
